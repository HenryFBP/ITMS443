<h1>Bill Morton Promotions</h1>

<h3><font color="#000033">Bill Morton Promotions is a promotion company 
registered as a legal business in 2009. It is the namesake of its progenitor, 
Bill Morton who has also been accredited as the owner of 4x Records and 
President of the Rogers Park Chamber of Commerce<br>
&nbsp;</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#000033"><br>
COMPANY HISTORY<br>
<br>
Starting as a musician in 1994, then forming 4x Records in 1996 – Bill Morton's 
signature includes ingenuity and challenging the traditional non-entrepreneurial 
norms.<br>
<br>
“<i>4X Records involvement in Atlantis these past 2 years has been obvious. We 
have seen increased activity across the board, from artist submissions to 
registration and the best thing about having them involved is their genuine 
enthusiasm for the event, they get it and that translates well to our clientele.</i>”<br>
- Mark Willis, Partner – Atlantis Music Conference &amp; Festival<br>
<br>
The enthusiasm of Bill Morton's think tank, 4x Records spread quickly throughout 
the United States and eventually world-wide with the partnerships of Sound Riot 
Records (UK), Cemetery Gates Promotions (Athens, GA) and Asteroid Booking 
(Savannah, GA).<br>
<br>
At the 2006 ten-year anniversary of 4x Records, Bill Morton was hired by Kate 
Smith Promotions to learn radio promotion and assist with operation of the 
business.<br>
<br>
Bill Morton supported Origin Records and Patois Records artists during his time 
with Kate Smith Promotions, as well as representing the company at the Annual IAJE Music Conference in New York.<br>
<br>
In late 2009, shortly after Kate Smith Promotions moved the Evanston office out 
of state, Bill Morton formed his own promotion company, Bill Morton Promotions.<br>
<br>
“<i>Supporting Kate Smith Promotions over the years provided me with the 
experience and relationships to get my clients new releases through the 
gatekeepers and on the air.</i>”<br>
- Bill Morton<br>
<br>
“<i>Although working for Kate Smith Promotions has given me an edge that very 
few promoters can enjoy, I feel that the masterstroke was to incorporate new 
media into the strategy to compliment my traditional radio promotion education.</i>”<br>
- Bill Morton<br>
<br>
As part of the new media agenda, Bill Morton merged 4x Records with his 
promotion company in March 2010, effectively devoting all of the 4x Records 
resources to grow Bill Morton Promotions. The most notable contribution to Bill 
Morton Promotions is the database of over 19,000 contacts including radio, 
television, internet and press.<br>
<br>
Eventually, Bill Morton would include the related Press Release distribution, 
Public Relations and Search Engine Optimization to his companies services.<br>
<br>
“<i>In 2005 I discovered Bill Morton with 4X Records. At that time I was doing 
music related promotions in the southeast and found Bill to be very helpful to 
my business. He actively helped me book and promote shows for the bands I 
represented.<br>
<br>
Over the years, Bill always kept in contact--he kept me up to date on his 
progress with 4X Records and I was able to follow along as his business 
developed by leaps and bounds.<br>
<br>
In 2009 I opened a music club in Savannah, GA. I also began full-time management 
of the band Sinister Moustache. I looked to Bill for assistance in promoting 
this band. I knew that Sinister Moustache fit into Bill's criteria for selecting 
bands for promotional services: original style, extraordinary song crafting and 
skill. I also knew that Bill's ability to connect with people, to create 
business relationships and to follow through with his services meant that he 
would be the best person to hire for Sinister Moustache. Bill has kept in 
contact with me over all these years and never let me forget him. If this is 
indicative of the attention he gives to all of the relationships he's developed 
in the musical world, then I know that he is a skilled promoter who can deliver 
what he promises.</i>”<br>
<br>
- Amy Stafford, The Wormhole Music Club &amp; Asteroid Booking<br>
<br>
<br>
COMPANY PHILOSOPHY<br>
<br>
Bill Morton was once given the business advice to &quot;<i>diversify your business</i>&quot;. 
Looking back at struggling niche promotion companies that he had encountered in 
the past, he decided that his company would accept all styles of music.<br>
<br>
“<i>When I am reviewing recording artists submissions to Bill Morton Promotions, 
I search for the great artist who is extraordinary, creating beautifully rare 
intelligently crafted works. All genres of music are within range, but it takes 
a master of their sound to really catch my ear.</i>”<br>
- Bill Morton<br>
<br>
Further diversity of the company would provide services to public figures and 
businesses with his promotion experience and media contacts.<br>
